# nashorn-shared-validation
This project demonstrates sharing validation logic between the browser and the application server running in Java.
 
Server-side validation is done in addition to the client-side validation to prevent anyone trying to bypass the JavaScript on the client.
On the server we are using Nashorn to execute the same JavaScript code that the browser used to score the password strength.
